### What is git?
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system. What is version control? Essentially, it’s a system that allows you to record changes to files over time, thus, you can view specific versions of those files later on.

### Why Use Git?
Over time, Git has become an industry standard for development. Being able to snapshot your code at a specific time is incredibly helpful as your codebase grows and you have to reference previous versions of it.

### How It Works
With Git, you record local changes to your code using a command-line tool, called the “Git Shell” (you can use Git in other command-line tools — I’ll refer to Git Shell through the following sections). Command-line lets you enter commands to view, change, and manage files and folders in a simple terminal, instead of using a graphical user interface (GUI). If you have not used command-line before, don’t worry, once you get started, it is incredibly straightforward.
